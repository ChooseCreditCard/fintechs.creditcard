          From app-first card issuers to embedded payments inside non-bank apps, fintechs are reshaping how credit cards
          are issued, used and experienced. This page explains the main patterns – without promoting any specific brand.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Do We Mean by “Fintechs” in Card Payments?</h2>
      <p>
        “Fintech” is a broad label. In the context of credit cards, it usually refers to companies that use technology
        to change how cards are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Issued – for example app-based onboarding and instant virtual cards.</li>
        <li>Managed – detailed spend analytics, flexible controls and in-app support.</li>
        <li>Integrated – cards embedded into other apps, platforms or wallets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some fintechs are licensed banks or full issuers. Others partner with banks or card networks behind the scenes.
        The user often only sees the app layer, not the full stack of partners underneath.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Business models -->
    <section id="models" class="section">
      <h2>Common Fintech Card & Payment Models</h2>
      <p>
        Fintechs often experiment with models that look different from legacy banks on the surface, even if they still
        rely on the same underlying card networks. Typical patterns include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>App-first card issuers:</strong> the card is tightly integrated with a mobile app, real-time
          notifications and controls like freezing, category limits or one-time virtual numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Embedded or “as-a-service” cards:</strong> non-financial brands that offer cards inside their own app,
          while a fintech platform and licensed bank run the underlying infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Specialised niche propositions:</strong> cards focused on specific segments such as freelancers,
          small online businesses or international travellers, with benefits tuned to those use-cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Alternative underwriting or scoring:</strong> some fintechs experiment with new data points for
          eligibility, always within local regulation and risk limits.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From the user side, the experience may feel very different, but the legal agreement and obligations are still
        defined by issuer terms and local law.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Risks & questions -->
    <section id="risks" class="section">
      <h2>Risks, Trade-Offs & Smart Questions to Ask</h2>
      <p>
        New user interfaces and features do not remove the basic realities of credit: interest, fees and repayment
        still matter. When evaluating fintech-style card products, consider questions like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who is the actual issuer and which country’s regulation applies?</li>
        <li>How is my money protected if the fintech company fails?</li>
        <li>What are the full costs: APR, FX fees, late fees, subscription fees?</li>
        <li>How does support work if something goes wrong with a transaction?</li>
        <li>Is data used only for running the service, or also for other purposes?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A slick app can be helpful, but clear documentation and strong consumer protections are just as important.
